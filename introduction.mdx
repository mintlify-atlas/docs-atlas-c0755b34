## What is MoFA?

MoFA (Modular Framework for Agents) is a revolutionary AI agent framework built in Rust that combines blazing performance with dynamic flexibility. Through its microkernel architecture and innovative dual-layer plugin system, MoFA strikes the perfect balance between raw performance and runtime adaptability.

## What sets MoFA apart

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Extreme performance" icon="gauge-high">
    Built in Rust with zero-cost abstractions and memory safety without garbage collection. Orders of magnitude faster than Python-based frameworks.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Write once, run everywhere" icon="globe">
    Auto-generated bindings for Python, Java, Go, Kotlin, and Swift via UniFFI. Call Rust core logic natively from any supported language with near-zero overhead.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dual-layer plugins" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Combine compile-time Rust/WASM plugins for extreme performance with runtime Rhai scripts for hot-reloadable business logic. No recompilation needed for updates.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Runtime programmability" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Embedded Rhai scripting engine enables hot-reload of business logic, runtime configuration, rule adjustments, and user-defined extensions on the fly.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Microkernel architecture" icon="microchip">
    Clean separation of concerns with a minimal, stable kernel and modular components. Easy to extend and maintain.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Distributed by nature" icon="network-wired">
    Built on Dora-rs for distributed dataflow. Seamless cross-process, cross-machine agent communication. Edge computing ready.
  </Card>

## Core features

### Multi-agent coordination

MoFA supports 7 LLM-driven collaboration patterns:

- **Request-Response**: One-to-one deterministic tasks with synchronous replies
- **Publish-Subscribe**: One-to-many broadcast tasks with multiple receivers
- **Consensus**: Multi-round negotiation and voting for decision-making
- **Debate**: Multi-agent alternating discussion for quality improvement
- **Parallel**: Simultaneous execution with result aggregation
- **Sequential**: Pipeline execution where output flows to the next agent
- **Custom**: User-defined modes interpreted by the LLM

### ReAct pattern

Implement agents that combine reasoning and acting through a "Think-Act-Observe" cycle. Built-in tools for web search, calculations, string manipulation, JSON processing, and datetime operations.

### Secretary mode

Human-in-the-loop workflow management with 5 phases:

1. **Receive ideas** → Record todos
2. **Clarify requirements** → Project documents
3. **Schedule dispatch** → Call execution agents
4. **Monitor feedback** → Push key decisions to humans
5. **Acceptance report** → Update todos

### LLM integration

Standardized LLM abstraction layer with built-in support for:

- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google Gemini
- Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, OpenRouter)

### Persistence layer

Multiple database backends:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- In-memory storage

Automatic session management and stateful memory for agents.

## Architecture overview

MoFA uses a layered microkernel architecture:

```mermaid
block-beta
    columns 1
    block:business["🧩 Business Layer"]
        A["User-defined Agents, Workflows, Rules"]
    end
    space
    block:runtime["⚡ Runtime Plugin Layer (Rhai Scripts)"]
        B["Dynamic tool registration"]
        C["Rule engine & Scripts"]
        D["Hot-load logic"]
    end
    space
    block:compile["🔧 Compile-time Plugin Layer (Rust/WASM)"]
        E["LLM plugins"]
        F["Tool plugins"]
        G["Storage & Protocol"]
    end
    space
    block:kernel["🏗️ Microkernel (mofa-kernel)"]
        H["Lifecycle management"]
        I["Metadata & Communication"]
        J["Task scheduling"]
    end

    business --> runtime
    runtime --> compile
    compile --> kernel
```

### Dual-layer plugin advantages

**Compile-time plugins** (Rust/WASM):
- Extreme performance, zero runtime overhead
- Type safety, compile-time error checking
- Support complex system calls and native integration
- WASM sandbox provides secure isolation

**Runtime plugins** (Rhai scripts):
- No recompilation needed, instant effect
- Business logic hot updates
- User-defined extensions
- Secure sandbox execution with configurable resource limits

**Combined power**:
- Use Rust plugins for performance-critical paths (LLM inference, data processing)
- Use Rhai scripts for business logic (rule engines, workflow orchestration)
- Seamless interoperability between both layers
